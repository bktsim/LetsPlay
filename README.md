# LetsPlay

LetsPlay is a website built for the SAP Invitational Hackathon hosted by SAP in Vancouver, BC. 

Competing with the theme of building a hybrid energized experience, our goal was to create an application that could bridge the disconnect and fill the lack of meainingful and personal connections caused by remote work at SAP.  

To tackle this issue, our team created a web application over 1.5 days - aiming to create an application that allows employees across the globe to connect with other employees of similar interests, as well as aiding them to create in-person, hybrid or online events for non-work purposes.

## Website Features
* Login with your email & password
* Add interests - or get autosuggested interests that others have already created. 
* Find users and events with *your* interests to meet new people!
* Create events and pitch your idea to those with similar interests.

## Tech Stack
* Next.js (TypeScript)
* NextUI for frontend framework 
* MongoDB

# Run the Project
This project was made from the [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) bootstrap. 

Although the mongoDB has been disconnected, you can still run the development server to get a look at the website by running the development server with `yarn dev` and viewing it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
